## Python, Django / Django / Belt Reviewer

### Assignment details
Using the below wireframe, create a Django application where logged in users can view and add book reviews. A user should also be able to delete his/her own reviews.

**Belt Exam Notes**

For the belt exam – and like many assignments you’ve already completed – you’ll be given a wireframe of a web application and asked to both create it (from database to front-end) and deploy it. *No need to worry about CSS styling*.

Any score above a 9.5 results in a black belt, while a score of between 8 and 9.49 yields a red belt.

The exam may be conducted during class if you’re joining the on-site bootcamp. Generally, you take the exam through learn.codingdojo.com/exams. The exam is timed; you’ll have 4.5 hours to complete it.

For the sample exam below, you can take as much time as you want. Here are helpful tips to help you earn your belt:

* Know that many of our black belt students had to take the belt exam two or even three times. These exams are NOT easy. We give these exams to those that apply to join Coding Dojo staff as an instructor/consultant, many of whom have 5-7+ years of experience, and 70-80% of them fail the exam. Do NOT get discouraged, and even if you fail the first time, take it again until you can earn your red/black belt. We believe that all of our students can get belts. It’s just a matter of time and perseverance.

* Make sure you revisit the SQL queries chapter. You’ll have to know how to do JOIN statements as well as how to do SELF joins. Make sure you feel comfortable with complex SQL queries before you take the exam.

* Make sure you understand how to pass parameters via URL (e.g. http://localhost/users/show/5).

* Make sure you really understand how to do login and registration. You will most likely need that functionality for the exam.

* Note: if your location offers iOS, the iOS track is rigorous. If you are unable to pass a belt exam with a score of 9.5 or better prior to starting the iOS track, talk with your bootcamp leader to make sure that you can achieve the goals that you have for the iOS program.

After you complete the belt reviewer above, we strongly encourage that you talk to other members of your cohort to see how they’ve done the assignment. Seeing how others have done the sample exam will help you to appreciate different ways of doing things and will help you to become a better developer.
